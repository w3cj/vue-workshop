3. Choose "No" for "Use history mode for router?" - You can choose "yes", but if you deploy, you will need to configure your server to handle this.
4. Choose ESlint + Airbnb config (my preferred config, choose another if you have a preference)

5. Uncheck "Lint on save" (you can leave this checked, but linter warnings will become compiler errors instead of just warnings)
